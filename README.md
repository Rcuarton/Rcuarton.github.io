        <h2>About me: </h2>
        <p>My name is Rebekah and I am currently working on my coding certificate to become a full stack developer.</p>
        <p>I beleive this industry is the best way to take my career to a whole new level. This will be a big change from
            my current role in healthcare (on the billing side) but is something I have been interested in years. I finally
            took the leap of faith to try something new and chase my dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will keep adding to this as the course progresses. Wish me luck!!
